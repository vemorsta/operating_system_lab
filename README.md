**Exercise 6 -- File and Directory Operations in Linux**

**Part A**

**1. Create Sample Files and Folders**

We begin by creating several files and directories whose names start
with `f` or `g`, and some of them end with a digit (0--9):

```bash
touch ffile1 ffile2 gfile3 gfile9 fdata7 gdata8

mkdir ffolder1 gfolder2 fdir3 gdir9
```
**2. Find Files That Start with f or g and End with a Digit**

To locate files in the current directory that:

- Start with `f` or `g`

- End with a digit (0--9)

Run:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -regex '\./[fg].*[0-9]$'
```
**3. Delete the Matched Files**

To remove all such matched files:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -regex
'\./[fg].*[0-9]$' -exec rm {} \;
```

**Part B**

**Copy `/etc/shadow `Contents into a New File**

The `/etc/shadow `file contains hashed passwords and is protected. You
must use `sudo` to read it.

To copy its contents into a new text file:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow > shadow_backup.txt
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Accessing or modifying `/etc/shadow` can pose security
risks. Only perform this step for educational or administrative purposes
with proper authorization.

**Notes**

- All commands are intended for use in a Unix-like terminal (e.g.,
  Linux).

- Run these in a safe, test-friendly environment (like a VM or
  container) to avoid affecting critical system files.
